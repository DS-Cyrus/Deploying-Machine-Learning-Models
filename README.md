## **Deploying  Machine Learning Model using Flask for Beginners**

When a data scientist/machine learning engineer develops a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch etc, the ultimate goal is to make it available in production. 

Often times when working on a machine learning project, we focus a lot on Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Feature Engineering, tweaking with hyper-parameters etc. But we tend to forget our main goal, which is to extract real value from the model predictions. 

Deployment of machine learning models or putting models into production means making your models available to the end users or systems. However, there is complexity in the deployment of machine learning models. This boot camp aims to make you get started with putting your trained machine learning models into production using Flask API. 


Some of the project we will handle in the bboot camp includes: 


1). Using linear regression to predict the sales value in the third month using rate of interest and sales of the first two months.

2).

3). 


Tool & Technologies we will use:

- HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Heroku and GitHub
